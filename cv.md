1. ## Summary
   Hi, my name is Igor. I hold an system administrator position in company which suplly a gas for personal and production use in region where I live. I have interested this direction of IT (Web applications) for several years, but only at last of them I learn it more. I'm thinking this knowledge give me oportunity to create in future useful and complicated products which facilitate a hard work for more people, not only for fun. I'm supposing also that allow me work with interesting people, who try to improve the world, who have a spark in eyes to create something awesome. It`s a hard, requareed a lot time, but in final you take a satisfaction from you work wich people use it a lot.
   I didn't have a relevant experience in software production, but i wrote some scripts for automation my current work.
   On the end of 2018 I finished the JS cource in https://loftschool.com/ and take a a sertificate about it https://loftschool.com/diploma/NPR12944JU213DDA0/en/pdf. But I need a more relevant experience in production and I don't have self-confidance. I hope the RS Scholl give me it.
